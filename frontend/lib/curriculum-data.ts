            <h3>Week 1: Moving Towards Sustainability</h3>
            <p>Sustainable agriculture is about growing food in a way that preserves the environment for future generations. This week, we dive into practices that save money and improve soil health.</p>

            <h4>Focus Area: Soil Health</h4>

            <h4>Step-by-Step: Seed Treatment (Beejamrut)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Collect cow urine, cow dung, lime, and local soil.</li>
                <li>Mix ingredients in specific proportions (as demonstrated in the video).</li>
                <li>Coat the seeds gently and let them dry in the shade before sowing.</li>
